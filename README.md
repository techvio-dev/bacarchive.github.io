# What is this exactly?

we noticed that most of the recourses the average morrocan student use to revise for his exams are outdated, from the 00s, aka not suitable for the average Bac student to reach any fine educational level without extra work, Bac Archive is a one-way open source project willing to hopefully provide high quality educational recourses for free to the average moroccan student at one place!

# Roadmap

Rome didn't rise in one day, so is every software project, here is a TODO list we are hopefully working on, contribution is welcome!

- Frontend ⌛
- Backend ⌛
- Collaborate on what should be added here ⌛ :P
