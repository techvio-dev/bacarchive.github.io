# What is this exactly?

we noticed that most of the recourses the average morrocan student use to revise for his exams simply suck
most of them are outdated, from 200X, aka not suitable, Bac Archive is an open source project willing to
hopefully provide high quality educational recourses for free to the average moroccan student!

# Roadmap

roma didn't rise in one day, so is every software project, here is a TODO list we are hopefully working on, contribution are welcome!

- Frontend ⌛
- Backend ⌛
- Collaborate on what should be added here ⌛ :P
