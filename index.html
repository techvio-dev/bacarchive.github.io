    <h1>Bac Archive - Under construction</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>We noticed that most of the ressources the average morrocan student uses to revise for his exams are outdated, from the 00s, aka not suitable for the average Bac student to reach any fine educational level without extra work.</p>
    <p></p>Bac Archive is a one-way open source project willing to hopefully provide high quality educational ressources for free to the average moroccan student at one place!</p>
    <p>At the moment, just wait for the project to be ready.</p>
    <p><i>Psst, wanna help us on improving this project? You can contribute <a href="https://github.com/techvio-dev/bacarchive.github.io">here</a></i></p>
