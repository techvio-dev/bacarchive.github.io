    <h1>Bac Archive: Under construction</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="letter">
        <p>In the quest for academic excellence, we observed that most resources available to the average Moroccan student for exam preparation are outdated, hailing from the 2000s.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, these materials are not tailored to meet the needs of today's Bac students aiming for a high educational standard without additional effort.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Enter Bac Archive â€“ a forward-thinking, one-way open-source project with the mission to offer free top-notch, contemporary educational resources, all conveniently located in one accessible platform!</p>
